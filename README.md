# HEIC to JPG Converter

A simple Python-based tool to convert HEIC/HEIF images to JPG format with Windows context menu integration.

## Features

- 🖼️ Convert HEIC/HEIF files to high-quality JPG
- 📁 Batch convert multiple files at once
- 🖱️ Right-click context menu integration
- 🎨 Preserves image quality (95% quality default)
- 🔄 Handles transparency properly (converts to white background)
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight

## Installation

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:
- Pillow (image processing)
- pillow-heif (HEIC format support)

### 2. Add Right-Click Context Menu (Optional)

To add "Convert to JPG" to your right-click menu for HEIC files:

1. Double-click `install_context_menu.reg`
2. Click "Yes" when Windows asks for permission
3. Click "OK" on the confirmation dialog

Now you can right-click any HEIC file and select "Convert to JPG"!

> **Windows 11 note:** The registry file also restores the classic context menu so
> "Convert to JPG" appears **directly** when you right-click — no need to click
> "Show more options" first. See the [Windows 11 section](#windows-11-classic-context-menu)
> in Troubleshooting for details.

## Usage

### Method 1: Right-Click Context Menu (After Installation)

1. Right-click on any `.heic` or `.heif` file
2. Select "Convert to JPG"
3. The converted file will appear in the same folder with a `.jpg` extension

### Method 2: Drag and Drop

1. Drag one or more HEIC files onto `heic_converter.py`
2. A command window will show conversion progress
3. Press Enter when complete

### Method 3: Command Line

Convert a single file:
```bash
python heic_converter.py photo.heic
```

Convert multiple files:
```bash
python heic_converter.py photo1.heic photo2.heic photo3.heic
```

Convert all HEIC files in a folder:
```bash
python heic_converter.py C:\Photos\MyFolder
```

## Uninstallation

To remove the context menu integration:

1. Double-click `uninstall_context_menu.reg`
2. Click "Yes" when Windows asks for permission
3. Click "OK" on the confirmation dialog

## How It Works

The converter:
1. Opens HEIC files using the `pillow-heif` library
2. Converts to RGB color mode (handling transparency)
3. Saves as high-quality JPG (95% quality, optimized)
4. Preserves the original filename, just changes the extension

## Troubleshooting

**Windows 11 classic context menu:**

The `install_context_menu.reg` file automatically restores the classic Windows context
menu so that "Convert to JPG" appears at the top level of the right-click menu. This
works by adding a registry key that tells Windows Explorer to use the legacy menu
renderer instead of the Windows 11 modern one.

If you want to revert to the Windows 11 modern context menu (and accept that "Convert
to JPG" will be under "Show more options"), double-click `uninstall_context_menu.reg`
— it removes both the converter entry and the classic menu setting.

To manually undo just the classic menu change, delete this registry key:
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID\{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}
```

**"Module not found" error:**
- Make sure you ran `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Try: `pip install Pillow pillow-heif`

**Context menu doesn't appear:**
- Make sure you ran `install_context_menu.reg` as administrator
- Check that the path in the .reg file matches your installation location
- Try restarting Windows Explorer (Task Manager → Windows Explorer → Restart)

**Python not found:**
- Make sure Python is installed and added to your PATH
- Try running: `python --version` in Command Prompt

## Notes

- Original HEIC files are not deleted or modified
